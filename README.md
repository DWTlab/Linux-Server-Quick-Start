## üêß All-in-One Update Command

For a quick weekly tune-up, you can chain the most common commands together. This single line will update your system, update your flatpaks, and remove any leftover packages.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && flatpak update -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
```

## üñ•Ô∏è System Health

Here are three key commands for checking system health and clearing out old files.

#### ‚ùå Check for Failed Services

This is the most important health check. It will tell you if any background processes have crashed or failed to start. An empty output from this command is a good sign.

```bash
systemctl --failed
```

#### üìî Clean Up System Logs

Over time, system log files can grow very large. This command will safely shrink the logs to a more manageable size (e.g., 100MB).

```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
```

#### üóëÔ∏è Empty the Trash

This command will forcefully empty your user's trash can. Be certain before running, as this cannot be undone.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/files/*
```
